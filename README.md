# Frontend Layouts

This repository is a collection of frontend layouts I’ve built to practice **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
Each layout focuses on improving my understanding of structure, styling, responsiveness, and interactive behavior on the web.

## Layouts
I’ll keep adding more layouts here as I create them:

- [Stats Preview Card](https://builtbykabir.github.io/frontend-layouts/stats-preview-card/index.html)
- [Layout 2](#) — Coming soon

Stay tuned 🙂
